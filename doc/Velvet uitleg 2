Velvet

Velvet is an assembler specially designed for datasets with short reads. 
Mainly the roche 454 and the illumina sequencers are compatible for velvet. 
Velvet has two tasks: to remove errors from the dataset, and then untangle repeated regions of the genome*. 
How this works will be eplained:

One of the tasks of velvet is to remove errors from the dataset. 
This is done with with Tour Bus. Tour Bus is a method that removes errors without 
disrupting connections within the graph as shown in figure 1,(ref velvet_poster-1) To do this the errors are removed when 
the whole graph is finished. (This maybe why velvet takes such a long time for a assembly. 
It first assembles with the errors and later revise itself to remove it errors. May seem to me as long lasting.)
Tour Bus recognizes two types of errors: tips and bubbles. 
These tips are made when low quality read ends don't overlap with anything. 
Therefore QC of the reads should be high to create less tips. The bubbles are created when there is an error in 
the middle of a long reads or two faulty reads are aligned to each other. 

Velvet's initial pipeline works like this:
1, Sequencing of the data
2, Hashing
3, Simplification of linear stretches
4, Error removal
