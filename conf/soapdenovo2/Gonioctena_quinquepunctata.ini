[LIB]

# This value indicates the average insert size of this library or the peak 
# value position in the insert size distribution figure.
avg_ins=200

# This option takes value 0 or 1. It tells the assembler if the read sequences 
# need to be complementarily reversed. Illumima GA produces two types of 
# paired-end libraries: a) forward-reverse, generated from fragmented DNA ends 
# with typical insert size less than 500 bp; b) reverse-forward, generated 
# from circularizing libraries with typical insert size greater than 2 Kb. 
# The parameter "reverse_seq" should be set to indicate this: 0, forward-reverse; 
# 1, reverse-forward.
reverse_seq=0

# This indicator decides in which part(s) the reads are used. It takes value: 
# 1 = only contig assembly
# 2 = only scaffold assembly 
# 3 = both contig and scaffold assembly
# 4 = only gap closure
asm_flags=3

# The assembler will cut the reads from the current library to this length.
rd_len_cutoff=100

# It takes integer values and decides in which order the reads are used for 
# scaffold assembly. Libraries with the same "rank" are used at the same time 
# during scaffold assembly.
rank=1

# This parameter is the cutoff value of pair number for a reliable connection 
# between two contigs or pre-scaffolds. The minimum number for paired-end reads 
# and mate-pair reads is 3 and 5 respectively.
pair_num_cutoff=3

# This takes effect in the "map" step and is the minimun alignment length 
# between a read and a contig required for a reliable read location. The minimum 
# length for paired-end reads and mate-pair reads is 32 and 35 respectively. 
# The assembler accepts read file in three kinds of formats: FASTA, FASTQ and BAM. 
# Mate-pair relationship could be indicated in two ways: two sequence files with 
# reads in the same order belonging to a pair, or two adjacent reads in a single 
# file (FASTA only) belonging to a pair. If a read in bam file fails platform/vendor 
# quality checks(the flag field 0x0200 is set), itself and it's paired read would 
# be ignored. In the configuration file single end files are indicated by 
# "f=/path/filename" or "q=/pah/filename" for fasta or fastq formats separately. 
# Paired reads in two fasta sequence files are indicated by "f1=" and "f2=". 
# While paired reads in two fastq sequences files are indicated by "q1=" and "q2=". 
# Paired reads in a single fasta sequence file is indicated by "p=" item. Reads in 
# bam sequence files is indicated by "b=". All the above items in each library 
# section are optional. The assembler assigns default values for most of them. If 
# you are not sure how to set a parameter, you can remove it from your 
# configuration file.
map_len=32

# a pair of fastq file, read 1 file should always be followed by read 2 file
